# Hacking_Depression
A list of things people are trying to help with their depression

This is a direct response to this question on Hacker News

So I thought I would start a list (since there were two things on the front page of HN that day already). It always struck me that self-help can be really effective (when combined with medical advice) at mitigating some parts of depression for some poeple.

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. If you have depression you should see a medical professional about it. Maybe you should ask them about the things on this list?

Please send pull requests with things to add or a revised order of things. Let's start it as a page on here and see how it goes. I have linked to Hacker News a lot, rather than the actual article as the discussions tend to be very instructive.
